*play around with your PlayStation devices*

## What?

playactor is a command line tool and node.js API for interacting with Sony
PS4 and PS5 devices. It is the successor to my older project,
[ps4-waker][ps4-waker]. It currently supports:

|                  | PS4 | PS5 |
|------------------|-----|-----|
| Wake             | ✅  | ✅  |
| Standby          | ✅  | ✅  |
| Keyboard control | ✅  | ❌  |
| Key/Button press | ✅  | ❌  |
| App/Game start   | ✅  | ❌  |

## How?

The playactor CLI tool can be installed using npm:

    npm install -g playactor
